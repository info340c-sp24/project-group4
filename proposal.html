        <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
        <p>Learning Korean can be a challenging task because of the languageâ€™s intricacy and vast differences from English. Traditional methods often involve textbooks, flashcards, and classroom settings, which can feel overwhelming to beginners and/or lack flexibility for users with busy schedules. Additionally, most existing language apps cater to a wider range of languages and not specifically Korean, which results in them failing to address the unique challenges associated with learning the Korean language. They often focus solely on formal Korean, neglecting the need and importance of useful cultural context as well as casual, conversational terms that would be relevant to any desired real-world application for learners. To address this, our proposal outlines a mobile app designed to make learning Korean accessible, interactive, and effective for users of all levels and availibilities.</p>
