        <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
        <p>Learning Korean can be a challenging task because of the languageâ€™s intricacy and vast differences from English. Traditional methods often involve textbooks, flashcards, and classroom settings, which can feel overwhelming or lack flexibility for busy schedules. Additionally, most existing language apps cater to a wider range of languages, not specifically addressing the unique challenges of Korean learning. These focus solely on formal Korean, neglecting the importance of useful cultural context and casual, conversational terms that would be relevant to any desired real-world application for learners. This proposal outlines a mobile app designed to make learning Korean accessible, interactive, and effective for users of all levels.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Study-Korean">How to Learn Korean - wikihow.com</a> provides a general overview of the challenges and approaches to Korean language learning.</p>
